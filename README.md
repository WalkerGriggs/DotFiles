# Personal DotFiles
Current dot-files and config-files for my many machines.
The include.csv file follows the format \<Static System File Location>, \<Relative Destination (Root if blank)>. This ties with the .bashrc 'dotfiles' function, which compiles all desired files into one git repo directory.

# My Environment

I finally got around to uploading some pictures of what my config files actually look like:

# WatchDogs
I saw an WatchDogs themed terminal, and wanted to stretch my bash legs implementing it. And when I say "stretch my bash legs", I mean, read in 2 easily overwritten files and print the string file if the boolean comes back true. I also added a 'watchDog' function to toggle between my standard bash config, and the ctOS config.

Here are some examples:
