Dotfiles
===================
Take these dotfiles with a grain of salt, and don't assume everything in here is best practice. Chances you find a legacy config from 2 machines ago are high, so make sure you read through the file before copy/pasting.

# Installation

I've shamelessly adapted my GNU Stow scrpit and filestructure from [Brendan Whitfield](https://brendanwhitfield.wordpress.com/2015/04/20/managing-dotfiles-with-gnu-stow/) and [Dylan Araps](https://github.com/dylanaraps/dotfiles/blob/master/install.sh). Simply clone the repo into your root directory and run the install script to dynamically stow the directories.
