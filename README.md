Personal DotFiles
===================
This repository contains many of my person .dot/config files. Take them with a grain of salt, and don't assume everything in here is best practice. Changes you find a legacy config from 2 machines ago are high, so many sure you read through the file before copy/pasting.

If you have find something you think is incorrect, or could be improved upon, feel free to create an issue or pull request.

## My Environment

After quite a few iterations, I finally got around to uploading some screenshots of what my environment actually looks like. That being said, I have a few machines, and these pictures are from my most recent Deb9 install:
